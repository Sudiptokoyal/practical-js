# Global Enviroment

Whenever you execute js code it runs under exceution context. Initially it creates global extuction context before it starts excuting your code and javascript engine create for you. It gives you two things **Global Object** and **this**. For Browser, GLobal object is `window`. For server side, it's diffrent.

Anything which are not under function got attached to global object or window.
